# Capstone Project Overview
Brainstation Data Science Bootcamp Graduation Project

The goal of my Capstone is to use data about past bankruptcies of US listed corporations to attempt to predict future bankruptcies.  My data begins with the University of Florida - UCLA Lopucki Bankruptcy database (center discontinued updates EO 2022) as my source of bankruptcy information.  To get detailed financial information on current public companies, I leverage public filer's XBRL-tagged financial data.  My analysis begins with basic EDA and modeling on a small set of financial parameters and will expand and deepen as I continue the project.

# Project Organization
- Sprint 1 - Identify potential data sources for project, conduct basic EDA and identify areas to generate valuable insight
